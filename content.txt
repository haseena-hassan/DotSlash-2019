<br>Hola Cetians!
<br>
<br>The emergence of  AR is taking technology through unexplored avenues. 
<br>Augmented reality devices may look like props from a futuristic science 
<br>fiction, but in reality, AR technology is being used in all sorts of 
<br>real-world applications. 
<br>
<br>DotSlash'19 presents the AR Game development workshop.
<br>
<br>”Our job as the game creators or developers - the programmers, artists, and 
<br>whatnot - is that we have to kind of put ourselves in the user's shoes. We 
<br>try to see what they're seeing, and then make it, and support what we think 
<br>they might think. “
<br>-Shigeru Miyamoto
<br>
<br>Due to constant rise of the video game industry, the demand for game 
<br>developers is increasing at a steadfast rate. We can give you the headstart 
<br>you need in your journey to put yourself up there with the best.
